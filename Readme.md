# How to remove colors from color collection in ColorPickEdit


<p>I have created an example that illustrates how to add the RemoveColorByName method, which allows you to remove a color with a specific name in a specific tab from ColorPickEdit.</p><br />
<p>RemoveColorByName is an overloaded method that takes the name of the list from which to delete a color as its first parameter, and the name or list of color names to be removed as the second parameter.</p>
